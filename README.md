### Accessory: Actual price
Shows the price, in the smallest denominator of the currency (Ã¶re, cents, etc).
This accessory will manifest itself as a light sensor, since there is no "energy meter" accessory type in Apple Home. 

The accessory will display `cents` as `lux`. Can be hooked up to automation rules.

### Accessory: Relative price
Shows the _relative_ price, in percentage across the day. Compares the current price with the highest point of the day.
This accessory will manifest itself as a humidity sensor, since there is no "energy meter" accessory type in Apple Home.

The accessory will display `%`. Can be hooked up to automation rules.


### Price graphing
The plugin can also generate a `.png` image, graphing todays prices (and tomorrows, if available).
The image will be rendered at 1280x720 pixels. Rendering will be done by an https call to [Quickchart.io](https://quickchart.io/)

In order for this to show up in Apple Home in any meaningful way, you can utilise [Homebridge Camera FFmpeg](https://github.com/Sunoo/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg) plugin to "stream" the image, as a camera accessory.


### Configuring
Configure via the Homebridge Config UI.

But if you need to do it manually, here's a short description of the configuration properties:
| Property                    | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                             |

| homeId                      | string  | no       | If you only have one house/home in Tibber, you can ignore this. However, if you have multiple, you should enter your HomeId here, to get the correct price information. |
| priceIncTax                 | boolean | no       | Show prices with tax/vat included                                                                                                                                       |
| activatePriceGraphing       | boolean | no       | Enable price graphing (Saved as a PNG every hour)                                                                                                                       |
| activatePriceSensor         | boolean | no       | Enable the "light sensor" used for current electricty price                                                                                                             |
| activateRelativePriceSensor | boolean | no       | Enable the "humidity sensor" used for current relative electricty price                                                                                                 |

#### Configuring ffmpeg camera plugin
Configure the camera via Homebridge Config UI, and enter this under `Video Source`:
```
-f image2 -loop 1 -s 1280x720 -pix_fmt yuvj422p -i <PATH_TO_HOMEBRIDGE_INSTALLATION>/.homebridge/tibber-price/price-chart.png
```

This works fine for me, but ffmpeg has a lot of configuration options, so feel free to experiment.

**Don't forget to replace PATH_TO_HOMEBRIDGE_INSTALLATION with the actual location**
